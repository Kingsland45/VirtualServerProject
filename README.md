# VirtualServerProject
A Linux Server VM running on VirtualBoxVM leveraging the Openstack Cloud to Create Web Servers Using QCow2 Ubuntu image. 

This system can be used for many things, but the key aspects are that it is relatively light, portable, free, effective, and has great customer and community support.

This is a backend project, and following it can give a great starting point for businesses or simply provide valuable education on a broad range of computer science server creation topics. It allows for cloud infrustucture and server creation in a controlled and safe environment. If there are ever any big issues, the VM can revert to saved states or outright get deleted without affecting the host system. 

Research and all work done by Austin Kingsland for my employment Portfolio.

There are files in this repository unrelated to the project, these are the two python scripts and the C++ file. These are here for the curious employer who may want to see some higher level mathematics or a more challenging coding project / file. Again, they are unrelated to my back end server project and will be removed at a later date.

Technology used: VirtualBox, Linux Server, Openstack, Apache, MariaDB, SSH, Nano, RSA encryption.
